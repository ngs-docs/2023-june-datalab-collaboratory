# DataLab Collaboratory - popups - June 2023

Link: [Main schedule page](https://hackmd.io/KhkZGZhyRt6pu4lbEHi6ow?view)

## What are pop-ups?

Throughout the workshop, we anticipate that lots of people will have common questions, or we'll identify common in knowledge, or want to demo various bits and pieces of technology.

So, throughout the workshop, we'll run pop-up sessions to cover "off-schedule" topics. There's absolutely no expectation that anyone will attend any one of them, but we hope and expect that people will find them useful!

Topics we anticipate running popups on:

* hackmd for collaborative Markdown editing
* RStudio Server, VS Code, etc.
* Screen, tmux
* SSH tunneling - pop up
* Editing bash profile
* tmux/screen popup
* Obsidian, and/or hackmd extras
* Advanced github? Branches, PRs?
* RMarkdown
* JupyterLab
* GitHub Desktop
* How to post an issue on the repository of a package Iâ€™m having trouble with
* Getting your data ready to apply ML and AI

### hackmd for writing and sharing docs in Markdown

hackmd is a tool that Titus's lab uses a lot for editing and sharing docs. It's particularly nice for collaborative note taking and writing tutorials.

Use cases:
* taking notes & writing tutorials;
* collaborative, real-time updates;
* rough drafts before posting things to GitHub;
* **can** do extra formatting beyond standard markdown, but not necessary to use;
* **can** publish to a public Web page
* **does support** access control

Technical details:
* collaborative, real-time, interactive editing of Markdown in the Web browser
* no login required, login via github useful
* _can_ (for a subscription fee) backup to github

Getting started:
* go to hackmd.io and sign up
* alternatively, [go edit a playground page](https://hackmd.io/mH2GadpITpGXrKaBPuxGxg)!
