# Workshop not-accept - Data Analysis Collaboratory 2023 @ DataLab

Thank you for submitting an application to the Data Analysis Collaboratory (https://hackmd.io/ONG4bcrQSxi2kdR_ADTp2A?view)!

Since this workshop is focused on fine tuning, refactoring, and enlarging an existing and fully functioning computational project, we think itâ€™s too early in your research for this workshop to be directly useful to you. We hope to offer additional workshops that more directly target your needs in the not-too-distant future!

Some resources that we hope you find useful in the meantime -

- DataLab runs many workshops! see: https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/workshops/
- This set of workshops from 2021 may be useful: https://ngs-docs.github.io/2021-august-remote-computing/
- For graduate students interested in learning more about bioinformatics, you might consider taking either the lab section of GGG 201b (link: https://hackmd.io/5ue0x068SvezhwQgjhjx-A) or GGG 298 (https://hackmd.io/Y3aIAoJsR_y-F-e2_UqZHw?view), both of which are offered in winter quarter.

Please keep in touch and ask questions as you have them!

best,
