[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/cY706EhiQU6Tw9azJ2L1lw/badge)](https://hackmd.io/cY706EhiQU6Tw9azJ2L1lw) or on [![github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngs-docs/2023-june-datalab-collaboratory/main/images/GitHub_Logo.png)](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2023-june-datalab-collaboratory/blob/main/resources/organizing-projects.md)

should:
* have all project-specific files under same top level directory
* files should be in git/github

may:
* clearly separate scripts/config from raw data from generated files
* contain all sbatch output files :)

how to get started:
* pick some part of your pipeline/scripts
* put them in git :)
* make sure they run
* make a copy of the git repo in a new location, run them from there
