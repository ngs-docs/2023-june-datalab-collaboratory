# Workshop Annc: A data analysis collaboratory

When: **June 20th-30th, 2023**, ~9am-5pm each day (except weekends; includes break for lunch).
Where: **Shields Library 360 (DataLab)**, UC Davis main campus.
How much: **Free**
Contact: Titus Brown, ctbrown@ucdavis.edu

This two week workshop will focus on improving the scalability and functionality of attendees' existing data analysis research by using HPC and cloud best practices. The first week is a guided tour that will get everyone's current Linux/R/Python-based workflows running on the UC Davis Farm compute cluster. The second week is a collaborative research computing hackyfest to level up those workflows by improving their speed, results, scalability, reproducibility, and validity. This in-person workshop at the UC Davis DataLab is open to all researchers, including graduate students. External researchers are welcome to apply!

**Description**

This workshop is for researchers with already functioning data analysis projects who want to "level up" their project to take advantage of bigger resources (High Performance Computing and/or the cloud), use more automation, improve their reproducibility, expand their output formats and visualizations, conduct parameter sweeps, add more data sets, and/or otherwise work to improve and extend their current work.

This is an interactive, hands-on workshop. Attendees should bring their own "pile of scripts," workflows, large data sets, etc.. This workshop is intended to help you make progress on your own research!

The workshop is free and is only available for in-person participation. Space is limited. Any materials will be openly available after the workshop.

The workshop will have a strong Code of Conduct.

**Recommended prerequisites**. Prior to attending, learners should:
* be comfortable with the basics of remote computing & ssh (e.g., through Lesson 4 of [this workshop series](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2021-august-remote-computing/)).
* have an already functioning project that makes use of R or Python scripts/notebooks or shell scripts on Linux or Mac OS X computers.

Experience with any other specific technology is not required!

**Attendee information**
* Attendees are expected to attend both weeks of this **in person** workshop. Events are scheduled from 9-5pm on weekdays, with no meetings on the weekends. There will be a flexibly scheduled break for lunch.
* The workshop will be held on UC Davis campus in the DataLab at Shields Library.
* UC Davis graduate students, postdocs, and faculty are welcome!
* External researchers are also welcome, space permitting!
* We cannot support work limited to closed or sensitive data sets as Farm is not HIPAA compliant; inquire for more information if you think this might pertain to you.
* We particularly welcome _pairs_ of researchers from research groups who are working on related or overlapping projects!

DataLab Affiliates will be given priority in case of space limitations.

**Workshop Content**. 

Technologies that will be discussed and demonstrated during this workshop include, but are not limited to:
* shell scripting for automation
* conda for software installation
* slurm for HPC job coordination
* git and github for version control
* Python and JupyterLab
* R, RStudio, RMarkdown, Shiny (and maybe Posit)
* snakemake for workflow automation
* the Farm cluster for analysis (Other campus HPC will be supported on case by case basis; inquire for more information.)

We are happy to work with any open source software that can be installed on remote Linux systems. Closed source or commercial software will be considered on a case by case basis.

Concepts that will be discussed:
* designing computational workflows for enhanced science, better reproducibility, and improved efficiency
* parameter tuning and parameter sweeps
* integrating visualization and cross-validation into your workflows
* parallelism vs. I/O vs. memory intensive workflows
* getting your data ready for machine learning and AI
