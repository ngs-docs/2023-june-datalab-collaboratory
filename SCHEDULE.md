## Introduction and Expectations

This workshop is focused on enabling attendees to improve and expand their existing workflows. All activities are optional but we hope to keep it interesting enough that everyone will attend and participate in the all-hands sessions. But you are also welcome to hide out in a corner and work on your own problems and ask for help periodically!

In particular, we hope to fill in a lot of gaps for people in their mental models of computing, and provide many ideas for how to improve the efficiency with which you work and compute!

This is designed to be a super-friendly workshop where you can ask all those questions about computing that you never felt comfortable asking before.

We're looking forward to seeing you all!

### Daily schedule

Each all-hands session below will follow the same basic format:
* intro to topic (15 min)
* Q&A, discussion and comparison (30 min - 1 hour)
* break out into facilitated co-working groups

We expect to have "pop-up" sessions on additional topics or techniques as desired.

Days will start at ~9:15, with lunch from noon-2pm; we will end by 5pm.
