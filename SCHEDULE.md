# Collaboratory schedule - DataLab June 2023

Edit: [![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/KhkZGZhyRt6pu4lbEHi6ow/badge)](https://hackmd.io/KhkZGZhyRt6pu4lbEHi6ow) or on [![github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngs-docs/2023-june-datalab-collaboratory/main/images/GitHub_Logo.png)](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2023-june-datalab-collaboratory/blob/main/SCHEDULE.md)


When: **June 20th-30th, 2023**, ~9am-5pm each day

Where: **Shields Library 360 (DataLab)**, UC Davis main campus.

Contact: ctbrown@ucdavis.edu, hehouts@ucdavis.edu

Parking suggestion: lots 5/5A are not that far, and you can walk through a small redwood grove! MU parking structure is also nearby (A and C parking). TAPS enforces parking; day parking permits can be purchased through the ParkMobile app.

Food: DataLab staff have started a list of [quick lunch options on and around campus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qvRRmImhpSY24YVewW_vT2EWGUaWYorQShQCbc7I_1c/edit?usp=sharing). Note: on campus venues may be closed due to summer break.

All information will be posted to our GitHub repository, [ngs-docs/2023-june-datalab-collaboratory](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2023-june-datalab-collaboratory/), and will be available indefinitely.

## Introduction and Expectations

This workshop is focused on enabling attendees to improve and expand their existing workflows. All activities are optional but we hope to keep it interesting enough that everyone will attend and participate in the all-hands sessions. But you are also welcome to hide out in a corner and work on your own problems and ask for help periodically!

In particular, we hope to fill in a lot of gaps for people in their mental models of computing, and provide many ideas for how to improve the efficiency with which you work and compute!

This is designed to be a super-friendly workshop where you can ask all those questions about computing that you never felt comfortable asking before.

We're looking forward to seeing you all!

## Advice for ongoing work goals!

Throughout this workshop, you may find you have downtime and/or need some sort of short term direction. Here are some ideas for what you can do!

* write a brief markdown document (maybe on hackmd??) describing how to run your project.
* make a small test or example data set or analysis that is (a) quick to run and (b) uses most of your scripts. This is a good way to make sure that your scripts still work and is really helpful for us in trying to help you!
* refactor/edit your scripts to run out of a single working directory - without absolute paths, etc. etc.
* diagram out your workflow!
* play with technology in a safe environment! hackmd, etc.
* take a step back and think about what you'd like to try out or achieve while you have lots of expert help around!

## Topics for pop-ups

Pop-ups are as-needed demos, lessons, and discussions where someone (or someones) lead a short session on some interesting piece of technology or theory.

We'll run pop-ups as needed throughout the workshop!

For technical details on pop-ups, see [the pop-up resources page!](https://hackmd.io/UecX-udsTkO4u7udQqsUwg?view)

Popup topics we anticipate:

Audience suggested 
* Google cloud
* How to use ChatGPT for fun and profit 
    * GPT3 is not reliable, but 4 is good
* Github copilot
* Github Actions
* Github codespace
* Github license
    * scholarly communications at UC Davis
* Bash command line variables

Pre-existing ideas
* hackmd for collaborative Markdowning
* RStudio Server, VS Code, etc.
* Screen, tmux
* SSH tunneling - pop up
* Editing bash profile
* tmux/screen popup
* Obsidian, and/or hackmd extras
* Advanced github? Branches, PRs?
* RMarkdown
* JupyterLab
* GitHub Desktop
* How to post an issue on the repository of a package Iâ€™m having trouble with
* Getting your data ready to apply ML and AI

Please add your own questions and suggestions to this section!
